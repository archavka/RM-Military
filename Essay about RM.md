power and ensuring efficient mission accomplishment.

institutionalization of techniques, tools, and procedures that lead to sound
decisionmaking and valid risk acceptance by Army leaders at all levels

RM is an integrating process. Army leaders first need to understand how RM generally fits into the
operations process (overarching framework for planning, preparing, executing, continuously assessing)

The five steps of RM follow a logical sequence that correlates with the
operations process activities

| Steps of RM                                | Operation process   activities | 
| -------------------------------------------|:------------------------------:|
| 1–Identify the hazards                     | Planning                       |
| 2–Assess the hazards                       | Planning                       |
| 3–Develop controls and make risk decisions | Planning preparing             |
| 4–Implement controls                       | Planning, preparing, executing |
| 5–Supervise and evaluate                   | Planning, executing            |

**Mission command** is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to
enable disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent to empower agile and adaptive leaders in the
conduct of unified land operations.   
**The mission command warfighting function** is the related
tasks and systems that develop and integrate those activities enabling a commander to balance the art of
command and the science of control in order to integrate the other warfighting functions. Both philosophy encompass and support RM.
