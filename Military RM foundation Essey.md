RM must be embedded in Army culture. Integrating RM into how we think is crucial to maintaining combat
power and ensuring efficient mission accomplishment.

institutionalization of techniques, tools, and procedures that lead to sound
decisionmaking and valid risk acceptance by Army leaders at all levels

RM is an integrating process. Army leaders first need to understand how RM generally fits into the
operations process (overarching framework for planning, preparing, executing, continuously assessing)

The five steps of RM follow a logical sequence that correlates with the
operations process activities

**Mission command** is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to
enable disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent to empower agile and adaptive leaders in the
conduct of unified land operations.   
**The mission command warfighting function** is the related
tasks and systems that develop and integrate those activities enabling a commander to balance the art of
command and the science of control in order to integrate the other warfighting functions. Both philosophy encompass and support RM.

Step 1 - Identify Hazards

An approach to identifying a hazard is to consider how the condition can lead to a sequence of specific events or an accident-loss scenario. 
The source or cause is a condition (such as a wet roadway) that is a
prerequisite to a mishap. The mechanism, or effect, is how the source manifests itself (such as by a vehicle
hydroplaning). The outcome, or undesired event, is the result of the mechanism occurring due to the source
being present (such as the vehicle leaving the roadway and striking a tree).
 To determine original hazard
(sometimes known as the root hazard or root cause), RM practitioners consider system inadequacies in
areas such as support, standards, and training, or leadership and individual failures.

To illustrate, tripping is
not considered a hazard because another condition or circumstance caused it. To identify the hazard, the
RM practitioner must ask why a person would trip in a certain location. Repeated questioning should lead
to the logical answer. When there is no longer a logical answer to the question, the original hazard has been
identified.

The mission variables—mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time
Some other resources and tools support the identification of hazards include:

* Experience and other experts.
* Regulations, manuals, standard operating    procedures (SOPs), and policies.
* Accident data
* War-gaming what-if scenarios
* Data from risk assessment matrixes
* Readiness assessments
* Cause and effect diagrams
* Change analysis
* Energy trace and barrier analysis
* Logic diagrams
* Mapping techniques
* Training assessments
* After action reviews (AARs)

The mission variables (mission, enemy, terrain and weather), also called the factors are used primarily as part of decisionmaking process or leading procedures for planning operations. In addition,
they provide a pattern for addressing threat- and accident-based risk for any activities, on- or off-duty.

Step 2 - Assess the Hazards

To assess hazards, RM practitioners consider how identified hazards (conditions) could lead to
harmful events and how those events would affect operations. When hazards are assessed and risk levels are assigned, the resulting analysis is a measurement of risk—probability and severity of loss linked to hazards. Risk levels reflect acombination of the probability of occurrence and the severity of the adverse impact. Probability andseverity are independent measures of hazards. In other words, estimating probability has no direct relationship to estimating severity. 

Probability is the likelihood an event will occur; it is assessed as:
* frequent
* likely 
* occasional
* unlikely   

Severity is the expected consequences of an event in terms of injury, property damage, or other mission-impairing factors; it is assessed as:
* catastrophic
* critical
* negligible
 
 A risk level is a type of score that assesses the odds (probability) of something going wrong and the effect (severity) of the incident when it occurs. 

Risk Levels
* Extremly High
* High
* Medium
* Low

Step 3- Develop Controls and Make Risk Decisions.

During control development, the mitigating effects of the proposed controls are considered. They reassess the initial level of risk and
determine a residual level of risk (risk after controls are implemented). RM practitioners continue
developing control options, considering their mitigating effects, and reassessing risk until they have
determined the most effective controls. The responsible commander at the appropriate echelon determines
the risk tolerance for the situation. The responsible commander makes risk decisions—to accept or not
accept the risk based on the residual risk level.

Effective controls meet the eight criteria of effectiveness (see descriptions in table 1-3):

Step 4 - Implement Controls

Army leaders establish how the controls will be implemented and who will manage them. They ensure
selected controls are translated into briefings and curricula and then integrated with training. They direct
trainers to develop practical training solutions. They ensure units receive safety equipment and instructions
on its use. Army leaders ensure subordinates fully understand and implement the controls. They ensure the
implemented controls are maintained to standard. Examples of ways to disseminate guidance and ensure
implementation of controls include:
* Overlays and graphics.
* Drills for vehicle and aircraft silhouette identification.
* Rehearsals and battle drills.
* Refresher training on intensive threat and friendly vehicle identification for all anti-armor and air defense weapons crews.
* Installation and maintenance of communications links for key civilian organizations.
* Operation of convoys with a prescribed minimum number of vehicles.
* Provisions to carry weapons and wear body armor and helmets when outside secure compounds.
* Accident awareness, safety briefings, and warnings. 

Step 5 - Supervise and Evaluate

Primarily, step 5 involves ensuring that controls are implemented and performed to standard.
RM practitioners apply this step to validate that selected controls support achieving the end state. 
They identify weaknesses of controls and make changes or adjustments based on performance or changing situations,
conditions, or events. 
However, supervision and evaluation are not limited to controls. 
Like other steps of RM, supervision and evaluation must occur throughout all phases of any operation or activity.
RM practitioners supervise and evaluate all aspects of RM continuously. 

Supervise

Supervision is a primary means of regulating forces. Step 5 fully integrates supervision into RM.
Higher-level leaders ensure lower-level leaders responsible for implementing controls understand their
responsibilities. They ensure subordinates understand how, when, and where to implement controls.

Situational understanding is a critical component of RM when identifying hazards. Situational
understanding is equally important in supervision. Leaders ensure that complacency, deviation from
standards, or violations of policies and controls are not allowed to threaten success. They ensure Soldiers
monitor factors such as fatigue, equipment serviceability and availability, and the weather and
environment. If they identify more hazards during operations, they can propose controls to eliminate or
mitigate them.

An extraordinary degree of discipline is needed to avoid complacency from boredom and
overconfidence when personnel are performing repetitive tasks.

Evaluate

RM practitioners conduct evaluation during all phases and activities of operations. Evaluation supports several goals, including but
not limited to:

* Determining if risk levels changed during operations.
* Adapting to changes in the situation.
* Monitoring effectiveness of controls.
* Making corrections to control implementation.
* Improving the application of RM principles in current and future operations.
